# Rust Practice Repository

This repository contains my personal Rust programming practice code. It serves as a learning ground for exploring the Rust programming language and improving my skills.

## Current Structure

The repository is currently organized as follows:

- `src/`: Source directory containing Rust code files
  - `main.rs`: The main Rust file where I'm currently practicing

## Purpose

The main goals of this repository are:

1. To experiment with Rust syntax and features
2. To implement small code snippets and exercises in Rust
3. To track my progress in learning Rust

## Getting Started

To run the Rust code in this repository:

1. Ensure you have Rust installed on your system. If not, visit [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) for installation instructions.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the repository's root directory.
4. Use `cargo run` to compile and run the Rust program in `src/main.rs`.

## Future Plans

As I continue learning, I may expand this repository to include:

- More Rust files for different practice exercises
- Separate folders for distinct projects or topics
- A `notes/` directory for personal observations about Rust programming

## Resources

Here are some helpful resources for learning Rust:

- [The Rust Programming Language Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
- [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/)
- [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/)

## Contribution

This is a personal practice repository, but suggestions and tips are always welcome. Feel free to open an issue if you have any recommendations or spot any mistakes in the code.
